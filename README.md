# Magento Load Testing Database

This repository just has a database dump for a Magento CE 1.9.2.2 instance 
that has 85k orders and 129k customers alongside the regular sample data.

Maybe eventually we can add other tools / conveniences here for load testing.

Note that it looks like pretty much all the products are out of stock.  This 
tends to happen when you place 85k orders :)  

You will probably need to add some stock and/or change configuration settings
to display products regardless of stock in order to get them to show up
on the frontend.
